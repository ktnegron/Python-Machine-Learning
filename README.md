# Scikit-learn to Predict House Prices
Building a linear regression model using scikit-learn's ``` Pipeline ``` with ``` StandardScaler ```, ``` LinearRegression ```, and ```Ridge``` predictor. However, some variables have a non-linear behavior and some basic feature engineering is done by creating new variables that encode the interactions we're interested in. We can use the values given by the product of each pair of variables which is what scikit-learn's ``` PolynomialFeatures``` does. Use this transformer to generate the second degree versions of each of the variables.
